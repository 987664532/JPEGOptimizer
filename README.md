# JPEGOptimizer Lightroom Plugin
__Coming soon!__

This plugin combines [jpegtran](http://www.ijg.org/) and [exiv2](http://www.exiv2.org/) in a post-process action to squeeze out a few kilobytes from your JPEGs without affecting the image data. It can be used during exports and with publish services.
